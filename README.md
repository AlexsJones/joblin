# ðŸ¦€ Joblin

**Joblin** is a minimal distributed job queue system, written in Rust, split into:

- `joblinctl`: A command-line client to submit and monitor jobs
- `joblinsvr`: A background server that receives, queues, and executes jobs

This project is part of my Rust mastery journey â€” designed to practice real-world async concurrency, trait design, CLI structure, and message passing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Learning Objectives

This project is helping me develop the following **advanced Rust skills**:

| Skill                | What I'm Practicing                                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Concurrency**      | Using `tokio`, `spawn`, `await`, task scheduling                       |
| **Async I/O**        | Interacting with sockets / local communication                         |
| **Trait-based design** | Modeling extensible job behavior using `trait` and `dyn`            |
| **Workspaces**       | Managing a multi-binary project with shared logic                      |
| **Error Handling**   | Using `thiserror`, `anyhow`, `Result`, and propagation idioms          |
| **Ownership & Borrowing** | Clean data flow between threads & components                    |
| **Serialization**    | Persisting job state using `serde` and `serde_json`                    |
| **CLIs**             | Using `clap` to build ergonomic multi-command tools                    |
| **Testing**          | Writing unit + integration tests for modular logic                     |

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
joblin/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Workspace root
â”œâ”€â”€ joblinctl/          # CLI client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/main.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ joblinsvr/          # Job queue server
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/main.rs
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

From the root of the workspace:

### Build the project

```bash
make build
```

### Run the server

```bash
make run-svr
```

### Submit a job (e.g., sleep 5 seconds)

```bash
make run-ctl ARGS='add --job "sleep 5"'
```

### List jobs

```bash
make run-ctl ARGS='list'
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Development Tools

- `make` â€“ common workflow automation
- `cargo fmt` â€“ formatting
- `cargo check` â€“ static analysis
- `cargo test` â€“ testing

---

## ðŸ§ª Next Stretch Goals

- Add REST or local socket communication between `ctl` and `svr`
- Support different job types (trait objects)
- Add status polling and live updates
- Optional Web UI with `axum` or `warp`

---

## ðŸ¦€ Why Rust?

This project is intentionally designed to challenge my understanding of:
- Rustâ€™s ownership model in multi-threaded code
- Async primitives
- Structuring larger, real-world Rust projects
